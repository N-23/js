                        Image() constructor.

        F. Array        New arrays can be created with the Array() constructor.
			Ex: var list_1 = new Array(100);  // 100-elements

				list_3 = Array [10,20, "what"]; // same as list_2
			A two-dimensional array is an array of arrays, each 
			one-dimensional
	methods

	4. list_2.slice(1)	results in [20, "what"]
	5. list_2.push("next")	results in [10, 20, "what", "next"]
	6. list_2.pop		results in "what"	
	property
	1. length

	G. Date		New Date objects can be created with Date() constructor
			as in:	var d=new Date();

			name
			options[]
			selectedIndex 
			value
	6. text		name
			value
	7. Text Area	name
			value

	I. options[]	This object is a property of SELECT menu.
			It indexes all of a pull-down menu options.
			Each option has the following properties
	1. index	The index number of a particular option
	2. text		contains the text string that appears on
			the menu for that option
	3. value	can carry a hidden value for that option.
	
	J. Math		A new Math object does not have to be created
			to call upon the properties or methods 
	methods
	1. random()	returns a floating-point number 0.0 - 0.999999
			takes no argument.
	2. pow(base,expo) raises the given base to the power of the second
			  argument.
	3. max(num1,num2)
	4. min(num1,num2)
	5. round(num)	returns its argument rounded to the nearest integer.
	6. floor(num)	returns greatest integer less than its argument
	7. ceil(num)	returns the least integer greater than its argu.
	8. abs(num)	returns the absolute value
	9. exp(num)	returns e to the power of the argument

	properties
	1. E		the base of natural log
	2. PI		the ratio of a circle's circumsference to its
			diameter

	K. String	This object is created automatically for each string.
			It is not a property of any object.
	methods
	1. charAt(ind)	returns the character in the string at given ind
	2. charCodeAt(ind) returns the ASCII number for the character at
			   specified index of the string.
	3. indexOf(char)   returns the first index of the given character
			   returns -1 if no such character
	4. lastIndexOf(char)
			returns the last index at which the char is found.
			-1 is returned if not found.
	5. substring(ind)
			returns a substring starting from the given index.
	6. toLowerCase()
	7. toUpperCase()
 
	L. Global	This is not a property of any object.
			Nor does it have to be referenced to call its methods
			We simply call the methods by name
	methods
	1. parseInt(str,num)
			returns the string converted to an integer in the
			base given by the second argument.
			If the second argument is omitted, the default is 10.
	2. parseFloat(str)	returns the string converted to a floating-
