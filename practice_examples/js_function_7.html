<h2>JavaScript Arrow Functions</h2>

<p>With arrow functions, you don't have to type the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly brackets.</p>

<p>Arrow functions are not supported in IE11 or earlier.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
/*// ES5
var x = function(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}
// ES6
const x = (x, y) => x * y;
*/
const x = (x, y) => x * y;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x(5, 5);
/*<script>
const x = (x, y) => { return x * y };
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x(5, 5);
</script>*/

</script>

<p>Arrow functions do not have their own this. They are not well suited for defining object methods.</p><br>
<p>Arrow functions are not hoisted. They must be defined before they are used.</p><br>
<p>Using const is safer than using var, because a function expression is always constant value.</p><br>
<p>You can only omit the return keyword and the curly brackets if the function is a single statement. Because of this, it might be a good habit to always keep them.</p>
