<h2>JavaScript Closures</h2>

<p>Counting with a local variable.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Count!</button>

<p id="demo">0</p>

<script>
var add = (function () {
  var counter = 0;
  return function () {counter += 1; return counter;}
})();

function myFunction(){
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = add();
}
</script>

<p>The variable add is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function.<br>
The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.<br>
This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.<br>
This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.<br>
The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.</p>
