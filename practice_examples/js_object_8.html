<h2>JavaScript Object Properties</h2>

<p>You can delete object properties.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var person = {
  firstname:"John",
  lastname:"Doe",
  age:50,
  eyecolor:"blue"
};

delete person.age;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<p>The delete keyword deletes a property from an object.</p><br>
<p>The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.</p><br>
<p>After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.</p><br>
<p>The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has no effect on variables or functions.</p><br>
<p>The delete operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties. It can crash your application.</p>
<p>The delete keyword does not delete inherited properties, but if you delete a prototype property, it will affect all objects inherited from the prototype.</p>
