<p>Global and local variables with the same name are different variables. Modifying one, does not modify the other.<br>
Variables created without the keyword var, are always global, even if they are created inside a function.</p><br>
<p>Global variables live as long as your application (your window / your web page) lives.<br>
Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, and deleted when the function is finished.</p>

<p>A function can access variables defined inside the function:</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  var a = 4;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = a * a;
} 

/*<p>A function can access variables defined outside the function:</p>
<script>
var a = 4;
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = a * a;
} 
</script>
<p>a is a global variable.In a web page, global variables belong to the window object.Global variables can be used (and changed) by all scripts in the page (and in the window).</p>*/
</script>

<p>In the above example,a is a local variable.A local variable can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is hidden from other functions and other scripting code.</p>
