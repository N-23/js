<h2>The JavaScript this Keyword</h2>
<p>In this example <strong>this</strong> refers to person2, even if it is a method of person1:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var person1 = {
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}
var person2 = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
}
var x = person1.fullName.call(person2); // Will return "John Doe" 
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x; 
</script>

<p>The call() and apply() methods are predefined JavaScript methods.</p><br>
<p>They can both be used to call an object method with another object as argument.</p><br>
<p>In the example above, when calling person1.fullName with person2 as argument, this will refer to person2, even if it is a method of person1.</p>
